    "# Introduction to FICO Xpress\n",
    "Xpress is one of the state-of-the-art mathematical programming solvers out there. In essence, it enables us to formulate and solve mathematical programming problems  linear or convex quadratic objective function and constraints. While the solver itself is written in C, there are interfaces to C++, Java, Python and Matlab. Here, we are going to look at the Python interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to model a problem with Xpress\n",
    "In this part, we will look at five different elements, which I think are the most important parts when building your model:\n",
    "1. Variables\n",
    "2. Constraints, including indicator constraints\n",
    "3. Callbacks\n",
    "4. More complex modeling elements (piecewise linear functions, multi-objective etc.)\n",
    "5. How Xpress let's you know something is wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Xpress has two parts you can work with: the `xpress` object, which is a static object that allows you to access things such as custom `Sum` operators, variable and constraint definition etc. Then, you have your actual model object, called `problem` in the documentation, which represents the specific model instance you are working with. Note that throughout this notebook I will abbreviate `xpress` as `xp` and my model object will be called `mdl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "### Creating variables\n",
    "All variables are created using the `xp.var()` method, the type of variable created is defined as a parameter of this method called `vartype`. The variable types at your disposal are:\n",
    "- `xp.continuous` for continuous variables\n",
    "- `xp.binary` for binary variables (lower and upper bound are further restricted to 0 and 1)\n",
    "- `xp.integer` for integer variables\n",
    "- `xp.semicontinuous` for semi-continuous variables, i.e. $x \\in \\{0\\} \\cup [l,u]$ with $0\\leq l \\leq u$ (see [here](http://yetanothermathprogrammingconsultant.blogspot.com/2016/08/semi-continuous-variables.html) for a nice description).\n",
    "- `xp.semiinteger` for semi-integer variables\n",
    "- `xp.partiallyinteger` for partially integer variables, i.e. $x \\in \\{l,...,t\\} \\cup [t,u]$ with $t \\leq t \\leq u$. This means, from $l$ to $t$ the variable is integer and from $t$ to $u$ the variable is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest about variable creation is pretty standard. You have `name`, `lb`, `ub` and `threshold` as parameters in `xp.var` (`threshold` only when needed). **Also, note that the default value for `lb` is 0.**\n",

    "2. You can only use $y=0$ and $y=1$ on the left side of the indicator. This means, if you wanted to write a general indicator constriant like the one above, you would need to manually write an indicator constraint that sets an auxiliary variable to $0$ or $1$, and then use that in the `addIndicator` method.\n",

    "Even though this callback is called quite a bit (around 100 times or so I think), it has a \"positive\" effect (i.e. no effect) on the performance. While this will of course not be true if you do more involved things in the callback, this is an indication that the callback itself does not really \"cost\" much."

    "How good is the Xpress Python API? Well, based on what I have just shown you, it depends: in some things it works very well and nicely, however there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially in the indicator constraints and modelling features department. Also a bit worringly, the addition of dense constraints seems to be very expensive, but I am not sure how other solvers would fare in this regard. But there is ways around this using `addrows`, where you manually add the row to the problem without going through the API, and thus removing this overhead.\n",
