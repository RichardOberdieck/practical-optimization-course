    "What do you do at this point? Well, since this is an example problem, the outcome is kinda on the nose, but not very far off from what you would find in the real life. First, we have to define what \"better\" means. Since we are given pricing information, it is reasonable to assume that we want to minimize our cost (the most common objective in mathmetical programming). The second question is much trickier though: who is \"we\"? This boils down to what degrees of freedom do we have? Do we have full control over the shipping? Do we have to hire third-party vendors that require certain volumes to be met etc.? This heavily influences what model you are going to build. However, as this is a simple example case, we can narrow our scope down to the following formulation:\n",

It is an extremely important and very deep concept, and feel free to go crazy with [this note](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~rtr/papers/rtr054-ConjugateDuality.pdf) and Chapter 5 in [this excellent book](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf).\n",

Those and other things are typically only reported in the log file and give a lot of insight into whether the solution is what we were looking for and how to improve on it. Also, most users would like some form of update on how their optimization progresses (unless it solves in less than 10 seconds typically), so you most likely will have to deal with the log from that standpoint (we will touch upon how to do this with callbacks in a later excercise)."
