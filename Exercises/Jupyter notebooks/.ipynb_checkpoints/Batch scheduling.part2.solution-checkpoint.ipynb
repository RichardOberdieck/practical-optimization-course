    "# Batch scheduling of a fermentation process\n",
    "\n",
    "Industrial fermentation processes are generally batch operations. The process consists of a\n",
    "number of phases or stages, each of which requires a considerable amount of time. Because\n",
    "of the time factor, the system cannot react quickly to variations in demand, so that the\n",
    "scheduling of production in each stage is of considerable importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a fermentation process which has five stages: (1) Mixing and cooking [$M$,$m$]; (2) Fermentation [$F$,$f$]; (3) Purification [$P$,$p$]; (4) Blending and packaging [$B$,$b$]; (5) Warehousing [$W$,$w$].\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_i$ ($f_i$, $p_i$, etc.) is the quantity that goes into stage $m$ (from the previous stage) in day $i$. $d_i$ is the demand (by customers) from the warehouse in period $i$. The demand $d_i$ is known (but not precisely). Given $d_i$, a set of values $m_i$, $f_i$, $p_i$, $b_i$, $w_i$ constitutes a production schedule. The capital letters indicate the total quantity in the stage, i.e. $M_j$ is the total amount of material in the mixing stage in period $j$.\n",

    "It is a good idea to select the unit you will be using from the start, especially considering factors of 10 (such as kg, tonnes etc.). In this example, we will always use $1000L$ as our unit.\n",
