    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "Python is an interpreted light-weight object-oriented programming language (see Wikipedia article [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))). Let's go over what those words mean:\n",
    "1. Interpreted: An interpreted language loosely speaking means the code can be executed directly, without needing to be compiled, i.e. translated into a machine language. This means, you can write `2+2` without having to define a program, compiler etc. This makes it akin to MATLAB.\n",
    "2. Light-weight: However, very much unlike MATLAB, Python does not actually need a lot of comping power to run. Of course, more computing power makes things typically run faster. But you can still develop sensible code with your standard machine without needing to beef it up just because you are running Python.\n",
    "3. Object-oriented: This is the most difficult one to explain for anybody coming from e.g. a MATLAB environment. The easiest way to explain it is probably with an example. Say you want to calculate the area of a rectangle ($A = wl$, where $w$ is the width and $l$ is the length). In MATLAB, you would probably do something like this:\n",
