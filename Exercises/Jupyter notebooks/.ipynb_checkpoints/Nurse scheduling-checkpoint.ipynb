    "# Nurse scheduling\n",
    "Companies that operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, such as factories or hospitals, need to solve a common problem: how to schedule workers in multiple daily shifts so that each shift is staffed by enough workers to maintain operations. In this next example, a hospital supervisor needs to create a weekly schedule for four nurses, subject to the following conditions:\n",
    "- Each day is divided into three 8-hour shifts.\n",
    "- On each day, all nurses are assigned to different shifts and one nurse has the day off.\n",
    "- Each nurse works five or six days a week.\n",
    "- No shift is staffed by more than two different nurses in a week.\n",
    "- If a nurse works shifts 2 or 3 on a given day, he must also work the same shift either the previous day or the following day.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable definition, initialization and data\n",
    "We start off by defining an appropriate binary variable $x_{d,s,n}$ which equals to $1$ if a nurse $n$ is taking shift $s$ on day $d$."
