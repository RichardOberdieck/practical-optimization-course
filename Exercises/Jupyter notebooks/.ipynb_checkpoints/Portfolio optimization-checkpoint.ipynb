    "# Making money with portfolio optimization\n",
    "One of the great applications of mathematical optimization is portfolio optimization, which was pioneered in 1952 by [Harry Markowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markowitz) in his seminal [paper](https://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/courses/ma362/07F/markowitz_JF.pdf) that earned him a Nobel prize in 1990. The essence of it is that when making investment decisions, you should not simply go by the highest mean return on investment, but you also have to consider the risk associated with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we are interested in making as much money while ensure with $1-\\beta$ percent probability that we are not going to loose money. To model this type of  probabilistic constraint, we can use:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\bar{p}^Tx + \\Phi^{-1}(\\beta)\\left|\\left|\\sum \\limits_{i} \\Sigma x\\right|\\right|_2 \\geq 0,\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative density function (CDF) of a unit Gaussian random variable, $\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix and $x$ is the fraction of the investment amount allocated to each investment. Note that:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\left| \\left| c \\right| \\right|_2 = \\left| \\left| \\begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\\\c_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c_n \\end{bmatrix} \\right| \\right|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum \\limits_i c_i^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "is called the 2-norm (or Euclidean norm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this constraint is the following:\n",
    "- $\\bar{p}^Tx$ denotes how much money we make on average. We now have to adjust for the uncertainty associated with our choice of $x$.\n",
    "- $\\left|\\left|\\sum \\limits_{i} \\Sigma x\\right|\\right|_2$ sums up the covariance weighted by our choice of investment $x$. In other words, the term represents teh *cumulative* risk we incur for a selection $x$.\n",
    "- $\\Phi^{-1}$ is the [quantile function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_function) and denotes \"the value of the random variable such that the probability of the variable being less than or equal to that value equals the given probability\". In other words, it answers the question \"how much would I have to shift my mean, so that I make sure that only a fraction of $\\beta$ is negative\" (check out [this plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_function#/media/File:Probit_plot.png), it may give you some clarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the idea is that we force the problem to find a solution where we can make sure that we will lose money only in a $\\beta$ fraction of the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data acquisition\n",
    "So let's get some data. But let's get some real data just to make it fun (I took part of this script from [here](https://www.pythonforfinance.net/2017/01/21/investment-portfolio-optimisation-with-python/)):"
