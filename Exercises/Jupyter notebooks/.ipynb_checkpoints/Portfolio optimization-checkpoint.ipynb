    "# Making money with portfolio optimization\n",
    "One of the great applications of mathematical optimization is portfolio optimization, which was pioneered in 1952 by [Harry Markowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markowitz) in his seminal [paper](https://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/courses/ma362/07F/markowitz_JF.pdf) that earned him a Nobel prize in 1990. The essence of it is that when making investment decisions, you should not simply go by the highest mean return on investment, but you also have to consider the risk associated with this.\n",

    "Specifically, we are interested in making as much money while ensure with $1-\\beta$ percent probability that we are not going to loose money. To model this type of  probabilistic constraint, we can use:\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative density function (CDF) of a unit Gaussian random variable, $\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix and $x$ is the fraction of the investment amount allocated to each investment. Note that:\n",
