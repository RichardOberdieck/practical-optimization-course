    "Employee scheduling (e.g. workers, nurses, doctors) is probably the oldest optimization problem ever. It was what George Dantzig was working on during World War II and what got him the interest of DuPont with his famous \"assign 70 workers to 70 jobs\" example. In this case, we are going to look at a more recent example, namely on scheduling the doctors for the paediatric units of five hospitals in Hamburg.\n",
